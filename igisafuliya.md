•	4 green bell peppers , seeded and cut
•	4 tomatoes , peeled, seeded, and diced
•	5 celery stalks , chopped (including leaves)
•	4 plantain bananas , peeled, cut in half lengthwise and then cut in half
•	10 oz. spinach , fresh or frozen
•	3 tablespoons tomato paste
•	4 tablespoons sunflower oil
•	1 hot pepper (optional)

Instructions
1.	In a pot with hot oil, sear chicken over medium-high heat to color on all sides.
2.	Add onion, leeks, and peppers. Stir and leave about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3.	Add the tomatoes, celery and tomato paste and mix well. Cook on medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring regularly.
4.	Cover with water, salt, pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes.
5.	Then remove 2 pieces of chicken, place the plantains, cover them with the spinach and put the chicken back on top. Add water if necessary, so that the bananas are fully submerged.
6.	Cover, add the whole hot pepper, and simmer over low heat for about 25 minutes. The liquid should not evaporate too much during cooking, as there should be a lot of sauce left.
