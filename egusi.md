Ingredients
•	2 lb stewing beef trotters (or goat or lamb trotters)
•	½ lb tripe
•	2 cubes beef stock seasoning (or chicken)
•	1 Scotch bonnet peppers (or more to taste)
•	6 tablespoons palm oil
•	1½ cup ground egusi (or whole pumpkin seeds, ground)
•	2 large onions , finely chopped
•	2 cloves garlic
•	1 (1 inch / 3 cm) piece ginger
•	4 medium vine tomatoes
•	Scotch bonnet pepper (or chili powder), according to taste
•	1 whole stock fish (or some smoked mackerels or kippers)
•	½ cup smoked prawns, left whole or ground (if using crayfish, grind them to a powder )
•	1 lb spinach
•	Water (as needed)

Equipment
•	Food processor

Instructions
1.	Cut the meat and tripe into bite-sized chunks and place into a pot. Add some onions and ginger to the meat, just enough to help with the aroma. Add a bouillon cube, top with water, and braise until tender. Cook for up to an hour to ensure the tripe is tender.
2.	Prepare the stock fish by soaking it in boiling water until the flesh is soft enough to debone.
3.	Place a large pot on the stove and heat up the palm oil. Fry the rest of the onions in the oil until caramelized.
4.	Blend the scotch bonnet, ginger, and garlic with the tomatoes in a food processor. Liquidize the ingredients until smooth then pour them into the pot.
5.	Cook them for 10 to 15 minutes until the sauce has reduced and thickened.
6.	Add enough water into the egusi to form a thick paste. Start with half a cup (120 ml) of water, and up to a cup (250 ml) of water for the egusi to be smoother in the soup.
7.	Drop the egusi into the soup either in balls or simply pour it in to steam. Cover the pot, reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes.
8.	Add the cooked meat, stock fish and crayfish powder (optional).
9.	Chop the spinach and put it into the stew gradually until it is softened and stirred well.
10.	Give the pot a stir then allows to simmer for a further 10 minutes.
11.	Check the soup for seasoning. Serve with a side of pounded yam or semolina shaped into balls. The egusi soup can also be served with rice.
